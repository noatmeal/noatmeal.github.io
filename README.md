A personal blog about mathematics. 

Contributions are always welcome. 

Please keep in mind if you do want to contribute that my design philosophy for 
coding in this project is to keep it simple and use as little javascript as 
possible besides one script entry for google analytics on each page. If you want 
to change any rendered math, you must edit the tex document, run pandoc on it 
(put the command here) and then copy paste in the output.  

To test locally:
1. Clone the repository and run `pnpm install`
2. Run `pnpm local`
