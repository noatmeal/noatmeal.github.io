    No more being clever. Be bravely repetitive and ugly with your presentation. 
    Throw mathjax back in and just get after it. The only script you should 
    ever use is what calls in mathjax. Otherwise just get cracking and accept 
    that you're only using a markup language with some boilerplate.
