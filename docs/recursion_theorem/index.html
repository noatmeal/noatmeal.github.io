      <h1>The Recursion Theorem</h1>

      <p>
        Among the first set of tools that one needs to create while working with 
        ZFC set theory is a theorem that allows for the creation of inductive 
        definitions. My goal in this post is to do exactly that.
      </p>

      <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
      
        <p>
          If the following material in this section doesn't make any sense, then 
          please refer to the first few chapters of a book like 
          "Naive Set Theory" by Paul R. Halmos. 
        </p>
     
        <p>
          <b>Definition 1.</b> 
          \( \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, ... \} \) and for \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) we 
          call the image of \( n \) under the successor function \(n^{+}\).
        </p>

        <p>The second and fourth peano axioms.</p>

      <h2>Statement and Proof</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Theorem.</b>
          For any set \( X \), if \( a \in X \) and \( f : X \rightarrow X \), 
          then there exists a function \( u: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X \) such 
          that \( u(1) = a \) and \( u(n^{+}) = f(u(n)) \) for all other natural 
          numbers \( n \).  
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Proof.</b>
          Let \( \mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P} (\mathbb{N} \times X )\) be defined such that 
          \( (1, a) \in c \) and \( (n^{+}, f(x)) \in c \) whenever \( ( n, x ) \in c \) for all \( c \in \mathcal{C} \). It's clear to see that 
          \( \mathcal{C} \) is nonempty since \( \mathbb{N} \times X \in C \) and so we can form the intersection of all sets in \( \mathcal{C} \) 
          which we'll call \( u \). Let \( S \) be the set of all natural numbers such that if \( n \in S \) then there exists \( (n, x) \in u \) and 
          if \( (n, w), (n,y) \in u\) then \( w = y \). We will prove inductively that \( S = \mathbb{N} \) which establishes \( u \) as a function.
          Furthermore, given how \( u \) is constructed, such a proof gives us exactly the kind of function we are looking for. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Suppose that \( (1, b) \in u \), \( a \neq b\), and consider the set 
          \( M = u \setminus \{ (1,b) \} \).  We claim that \( (n^{+}, f(x)) \in M \) whenever \( ( n, x ) \in M \). If that weren't the case then
          some \( (n^{+}, f(x)) \) would not be present in \( M \) for some \( (n,x) \in M \). Well by the definition of \( M \), for all \( \alpha \)
          we have that
          \( (\alpha \in u \land \alpha \neq (1,b)) \rightarrow \alpha \in M \) which implies that if \( \alpha \not\in M \), then 
          \( \alpha \not\in u \lor \alpha = (1, b) \). Well  it can't be the case that \( (1,b) = (n^{+},f(x)) \) 
          since \( n^{+} \neq 1 \) for any natural number \( n \). So then we must conclude that \( (n^{+}, f(x)) \not\in u \) 
          which contradicts \( u \)'s initial construction since \( (n,x) \in u \) by the assumption that \( (n,x) \in M \). Therefore, 
          since \((1,a) \in M \) and for any other \( (1,b) \in M \) we know that \( a = b \), we conclude that \( 1 \in S \). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Now suppose that \( n \in S \) which implies that there is an \( (n,x) \in u \) for at most one \( x \). It follows from the definition of 
          \( u \) that \( (n^{+}, f(x)) \in u \). Now if \( n^{+} \) isn't in \( S \), then there exists \( (n^{+}, y) \in u \) such that \( f(x) \neq y \).
          Consider the set \( J = u \setminus \{(n^{+},y)\} \) and some \( (m, t) \in J \). If \( m = n \), then \( t = x \) since \( n \in S \) and so 
          \( (n^{+}, f(x)) = (m^{+},f(t)) \in J \). By construction of J, we note that \( \alpha \not\in J \rightarrow (\alpha \not\in u \lor 
          \alpha = (n^{+},y))\). So if \( m \neq n \), then we know that \( m^{+} \neq n^{+} \) by the fourth Peano axiom and so if 
          \( (m^{+}, f(t)) \not\in J \) then we must conclude that \( (m^{+}, f(t)) \not\in u \) which is a contradiction to the construction of 
          \( u \). So \( n^{+} \in S \) and by the principal of mathematical induction we conclude that \( \mathbb{N}  = S \).
